# Sales_Project

I would like to share details about my BI project developed in Power BI, where I integrated Python for the ETL process. The project focuses on analyzing data from a company that specializes in manufacturing bicycles, with the goal of gaining insights into sales, customer behavior, and market trends.

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was implemented using Python scripts to extract data from various sources such as databases, in xlsx files The extracted data was then transformed to prepare it for analysis. This involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, aggregating information, and creating new features for enhanced analysis.

In Power BI, I designed interactive dashboards and visualizations to showcase key metrics and KPIs related to bicycle sales. The dashboards include charts, graphs, and tables that provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, , popular products, and regional sales trends.

No geral, o projeto de BI em Power BI com Python ETL, complementado pelo Figma para design de layout, forneceu insights valiosos e inteligência acionável para a empresa, permitindo a tomada de decisões informadas e impulsionando o crescimento dos negócios na competitiva indústria de bicicletas.
